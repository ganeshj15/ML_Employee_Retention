# ML_Employee_Retention
Prediction model for employee will leave the organization or not.

We will use the Logistic Regression from SKlearn, since our target is a binary in nature like employee will leave or not.So we will build the logistic regrssion model with following steps.
  1. Will do some exploratory data analysis to figure out which variables have direct and clear impact on employee retention (i.e. whether they leave the company or continue to work)
  2. Plot bar charts showing impact of employee salaries on retention
  3. Plot bar charts showing corelation between department and employee retention
  4. Now build logistic regression model using variables that were narrowed down in step 1
  5. Measure the accuracy of the model
